## Purpose

Evaluate molecular integrals purely in Python, without the need of any
compiled libraries.

## Progress

Note that this project is still under development. Currently, the following
molecular integrals are implemented:

- [x] Overlap integrals
- [x] Kinetic integrals
- [x] Nuclear integrals
- [x] Dipole integrals
- [x] Two-electron integrals

And also the following geometric derivatives:

- [x] Overlap derivatives
- [ ] Kinetic derivatives
- [ ] Nuclear derivatives
- [ ] Two-electron integrals
